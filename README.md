# Face Recognition using Principal Component Analysis

Creattion of a basic facial recognition system using a technique called principal component analysis (PCA).
By projecting the face images on the feature space (face space) which best represents the variations among distinct faces. 
The face space is defined as the â€œEigenfaces", which are the eigenvectors of the set of faces.
